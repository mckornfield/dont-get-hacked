_Scammer: We never received them. Sir this is a pressing matter, and we need some information to continue... What is your social security number?_

## Accounts?

- Accounts are your identity on the internet in a specific place
- Someone who can access your account _can impersonate you_

--

## Accounts compromises

- Data breaches
- Brute force attacks
- Credential stuffing

--

## Golden Rules of Account Security

- Never reuse the same password
- Never use a weak, easy to guess password

--

## Best way to accomplish the above?

- A Password Manager

--

## LastPass (as an example)

![password manager example](images/password_manager.png)

--

## Good Password Managers?

- LastPass
- 1Password
- Bitwarden
- Keeper

Ask your tech buddy!

## What kinds are there?

1. Generated Codes (Authenticator Apps)
1. Phone Text Messages/ Phone Calls
